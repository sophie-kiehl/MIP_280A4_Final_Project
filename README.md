# MIP_280A4_Final_Project

In this project, I used Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data from a _Planococcus_ genome to identify its species using de novo assembly, BLAST, and genome alignments. I found that my bacteria has 1 plasmid and likely 1 chromosome. A possible candidate for its species is _Planococcus maritimus_.
