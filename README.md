# MIP_280A4_Final_Project

In this project, I used Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data from a _Planococcus_ genome to identify its species using de novo assembly, BLAST, and genome alignments. I found that my bacteria has 1 plasmid and likely 1 chromosome. A possible candidate for its species is _Planococcus maritimus_. 

The steps that I used in this project are recorded in report.md. The conda environment I used is stored in conda_env. All of the results are found in their labeled folders, although these are also linked in report.md as they appear.
